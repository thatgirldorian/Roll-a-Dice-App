# Roll-a-Dice-App
 This is an app for when you can't decide who's right or where to eat. Just roll a dice!
 
 <h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is an app that lets you roll a dice to make decisions. I added two buttons: one for randomising each outcome and another for refreshing the page + reloading the window. This second button refreshes the page.

<h3>Issues and solutions faced:</h3>

- At first, I struggled with how to randomise the images but I was able to put them in an array and used a function alongside some Math methods to pick them out randomly.

- Also, I did not know how to tell when one image was greater than the other at first. So, I created a variable for each set image at any given time, got their index with the indexOf method and then used this in an if statement.
